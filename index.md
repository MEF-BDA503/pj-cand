# Duygu Can's Progress Journal 

## Week 4 (Nov 11)
I am at the beginning of Lesson 3 on the Udacity course. Meanwhile, I've gone through [Tidyverse Recap Exercise](https://mef-bda503.github.io/files/tidyverse_recap_p1.html).
I regenerated all the tasks except the last question of the Final Exercises (still working on it), with my own. You can find my solutions [here](files/Travel_and_Weather.html).
Notice that for some questions I added slight variations.

## Week 3 (Oct 24)

+ The data set I am using is "School life expectancy, primary to tertiary by gender" obtained from [UN](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=GenderStat&f=inID%3a85). [Here](files/EDAonDS.html) is my initial exploratory data analysis on it.
+ We decided on the groups. Our group name is unknown, yet. Other members are Meryem Kemerci, Cihan Tektunali and Murat Donmez.

# Udacity Update
I finished Lesson 2 on the Udacity course. I did all the work required and all the quizes. But still this homework is beyond my current skills.

## Week 2 (Oct 10)

+ [Here](files/example_homework_1.html) is my 5 not so interesting R examples. Enjoy!
